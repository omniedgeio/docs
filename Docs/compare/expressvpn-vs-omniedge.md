# ExpressVPN vs. OmniEdge



If you're looking for the best VPN, you've probably heard of ExpressVPN and OmniEdge. Both services are extremely popular among consumers and tech professionals alike, with thousands of users giving their feedback on both services. ExpressVPN and OmniEdge are two different technologies that can both provide secure access to your corporate network. They both have their pros and cons. However, you should choose the one that fits your needs best.

But what are the differences between these two popular providers? How do they compare against one another? And which service is right for you?

## A Brief Introduction

ExpressVPN is a virtual private network service designed for personal usage at home. It supports a large number of devices and features 256-bit encryption and split tunneling. You can also use ExpressVPN to secure all devices connected to your network by configuring it on your router. The main purpose to use ExpressVPN is using it as a relay or hide the IP. **However, you will share the same server with same IP with the other strange users you don't know.** 

OmniEdge is a cloud-based application that provides enterprise-level security, visibility, and control across your entire network infrastructure. It creates a peer-to-peer tunnel between two nodes, as well as a virtual network for any connected devices. OmniEdge provides a single pane of glass view into your entire network infrastructure–including physical devices, virtualized servers, applications, containers, and cloud services–to quickly understand what is happening on any device at any time. You can create multiple virtual networks for different purpose, and control the nodes which are connecting to related virtual networks.

## Security and Privacy

Here's a rundown of what ExpressVPN has to offer:

- VPN protocols with encryption
- A dedicated DNS server
- Network Lock and Leak Protection (the ExpressVPN version of a kill switch)

Here's a list of what OmniEdge has to offer:

- P2P MESH networks
- Encrypted end-to-end by Two-fish,
- Customized authentication and 2FA(Enterprise Plan) to achieve dual security confirmation of devices and users with GDPR in mind.

In terms of security, ExpressVPN implements OpenVPN protocol and 256-bit encryption, which makes it difficult for even the most powerful governments to decipher your traffic. However, OmniEdge offers even better ciphers which also doesn't have any known issues with logging customer data or other privacy concerns.

## Streaming

ExpressVPN allows P2P file sharing on their networks and lets you torrent anonymously. Users use the shared center VPN server as a public exit to visit the target sites, hiding behind the server. 

OmniEdge allow users sharing their files, streaming in between their own private network between their nodes. Only verified or invited users can have the access to the files or streamings.
