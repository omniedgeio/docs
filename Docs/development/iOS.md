# Build OmniEdge for iOS

1. Download and install Xcode
2. Get the repo and compile

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omniedgeio/omniedge-iOS.git
cd omniedge-iOS
open OmniEdgeNew/OmniEdgeNew.xcworkspace
```

Xcode will open automatically, you have to set your developer account to start the compile. We recommend compiling the package on your devices separately, specially the **Tunnel** package.
